Machine Learning Final Project

Group Members: Andrew King, Jared Pangallozzi, Harshil Desai, Manan Aggarwal

### To run code:

In order to run the code you must first download the Yale Faces Dataset at the following link: http://vision.ucsd.edu/content/yale-face-database

After unzipping, the file containing the data must be in the same directory as the notebook in order for it to be imported correctly into our code.
